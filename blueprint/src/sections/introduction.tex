\chapter*{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to formalize the information theory notions needed in the paper \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01892}{[Degenne and Mathieu, Information Lower Bounds for Robust Mean Estimation, 2024]}.

A very useful book (draft) about information theory and hypothesis testing: \cite{polyanskiy2024information} 

Main reference for the properties of the RÃ©nyi divergence: \cite{van2014renyi}
